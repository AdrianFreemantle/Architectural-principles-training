==================

In a CRUD style system the entities are simply read, created, updated and deleted. CRUD works with entities and those entities are changed by retrieving data from a service or database, modifying the data by setting properties, and then sending the data back to the service or database for update. 
CRUD is data-oriented. We don’t perform a specific business action, just ask the service or database to create, delete or update the entity by giving the service or database the new data for that entity. If more needs to be done, the service analyses the data changes to determine what action to take.
